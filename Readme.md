### Upstreams

Targets are the destinations that our Upstream targets are essentially the addresses of the servers that host the services. For each server, we will create a corresponding target

### Services

Service entities, as the name implies, are abstractions of each of your own upstream services. Examples of Services would be a data transformation microservice, a billing API, etc.

### Route

A route is a set of rules for Kong match requests to exactly the API on the services it needs.
